 MCS-375 Fall 2018
 Project 05 Hill Climbing Bikers
 Description: 
 This program reads in the file from standard input containing several
 cases. The first line of every case will hold the size, the starting
 position and the ending position. Afterwards, it will contain a grid with
 weights showing the height of each hill. The end of the program will be 
 denoted by the use of the line with 0 0 0 0 0. Arbitrary white spaces will 
 be delimited. This program will determine the cheapest cost path from the 
 starting point to the end and then calculate the biggest slope out of the 
 hills traversed.
